Augmented Reality with Kinect, book source code
=======================================

This is the source code package of the book Augmented Reality with Kinect, written by Rui Wang and published by the Packt Publishing in July, 2013.

It already includes the FreeImage and FreeGLUT libraries. All you need is to install Microsoft Kinect correctly and prepare the Visual Studio environment for developing work.

Please make sure that you have already installed a newer version (equal or greater than 2010) of Microsoft Visual Studio. You will find the solution file in the 'build' subfolder. Open it with the Visual Studio environment and compile it to see the results.

Another way to taste the example code is to execute build_me.bat directly. It will call the 'premake' tool to generate solution files corresponding with your system. And then you can view and compile the newly-created solution file in the 'build' subfolder.
